## Hi, I'm Melissa ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
Currently taking CSC-134 and getting ready to learn C++!

## My Foo (special interest)ðŸŽ¯
I have always been super career focused but I'd say my careers have led me to really love anything involving being active and physical fitness. I workout alot and love anything I can do outdoors with my dog!

## Currently Learning
-C++

## Fun Fact
I served 7 years in the Army Reserves as an Engineer that specialized in plumbing and I served 4 years active duty in the Army as Airborne Infantry. While I was in the Army Reserves my full time job was as a Police Officer in Knoville Tennessee until I went active in 2020. I recently got out last August and now I am working towards my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering.
